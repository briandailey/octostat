### Octostat

An online repository of mobile-friendly interactive tools for teaching new students about statistics.


### The Goal

* Create a repository of visualization that can teach new students basics of statistics (about sample sizes, normal distribution, and other concepts)
* Create visualizations that are mobile-friendly since many students have access to a mobile device in the classroom
* Accept contributions from other developers and statisticians to address more basic concepts.
* Teach students how to use Github (fork projects, create new visualizations, create a pull request)
